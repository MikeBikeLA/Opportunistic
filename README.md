# CS205 Final Project

## The Task:
- 

## File list:
- **nhanes.py:** implementation of the data preprocessing logic as well as definition an example dataset.
- **Demo_Dataset.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook file to demonstrate the basic usage of sample dataset.

## How to use:
1) Download [raw data files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hFp7O747408D8t5442f0Sjit7wXKXI1z/view?usp=sharing) and decompress them.
2) Install Python 3 and the following packages: joblib, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn, jupyter, pytorch.
3) Use Demo_Dataset.ipynb to see an example on how to use the predefined task.
4) Alternatively, you can expand nhanes.py to define new tasks by following the implementation logic of the provided sample.
